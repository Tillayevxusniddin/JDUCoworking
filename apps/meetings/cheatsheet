2. Required OAuth Scopes:

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events

Instructions for the Administrator:
Log in to the Google Admin Console at admin.google.com.

Navigate to Security > Access and data control > API controls.

Click on Manage Domain-Wide Delegation.

Click Add new.

In the Client ID field, paste the Client ID from above.

In the OAuth Scopes field, paste the comma-separated list of scopes from above.

Click Authorize.

Thank you for your assistance.
